# MuteHuntShowdown

This is a script to mute a running Hunt: Showdown instance in the windows sound mixer.

It uses **Alt+M** to on/off the mute.

There is a compiled version of the script [**MuteHuntShowdown.exe**](compiled/MuteHuntShowdown.exe).
This is a standalone and can be executed directly. Even without AutoHotkey installed. Just download and execute.
*It may happen that Windows issues a security warning the first time you run the exe file. This can be ignored with trusted sources like this one. ;) Press continue under details.*

If you are using the AutoHotkey.exe to launch the scripts, the keyboard shortcut can be changed in the [MuteHuntShowdown.ahk](ahk/MuteHuntShowdown.ahk).


To stop the script just rightclick it in the windows toolbar und click *exit*.

The script is based on a snippet from *Linear Spoon* posted in [the autohotkey board](//autohotkey.com/board/topic/119506-get-volume-mixer-application-specific-mute-button-state/?p=682808) and use [Vista Audio Control Functions](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/21984-vista-audio-control-functions/?p=143564).
